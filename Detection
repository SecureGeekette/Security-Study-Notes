Components of an Intrusion Detection System:
- Input: System Activity (i.e. audit records in the form of logs)
- Audit Data Preprocessor (data is parsed and preprocessed in an security information and event management system)
- This data is then fed to detection engine which relies on either signature based/ statistical based models (collected from past evidence)
- Alarm generation and response 


Signature Based Detections:
Set of rules defining a behavior associated with an attack of a certain type
For eg. SYN Attacks: Large numbers of SYN packets without ACK's (could also be poor connections)
For eg. Buffer Overflows: Very long arguments to string functions, a network packet has a lot of NOP's in it, a setuid program spawns a shell with certain arguments.
However, attack  signatures are very specific and may miss variants of known attacks (eg. polymorphic virus). A large space of security consists of fast and automatic extraction of signtures for new attacks.

Anomaly Detection:
This mechanism describes a "profile" describing "normal" behavior. Works best for small well-defined systems rather than large multi-user systems.
Also, results in high number of false positives since anomalies can just be new normal activities.
Most profiles are based on statistical mechanisms:
- These can be built manually (very hard)
- Machine learning and data mining techniques are generally utilized. This includes logging system activities for a certain duration and then train the IDS to recognize normal and abnormal patterns. 
Risk: Attackers can train IDS to accept their activity as the new normal. Daily low volumes of port scans may train the IDS to assume this behavior as normal.

IDS deployment can primarily be of 2 types:
- Host Based
- Network Based

Host Based IDS uses host OS auditing mechanims to log all direct and indirect events generated by a user (shell commands etc.) or system calls made by programs.

Network IDS consists of deploying sensors at strategic locations (eg. packet sniffing via tcpdump at routers). This allows the IDS to inspect network traffic for violation of protocols and detect unsual connection patterns. Data portions of packets can also be analyzed in network IDS for malicious command sequences.
Advantage: Single NIDS can protect many hosts and look for global patterns.
Risk: May be easily defeated by encryption
