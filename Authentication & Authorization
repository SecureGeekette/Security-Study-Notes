Authentication is used to verify that you are who you say you are i.e. validate a user's identity.
User authentication is the priority while responding to a request made by a software application.

Let's discuss some commonly used authentication protocols:

Kerberos (Used in Active Directory):

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol developed by MIT. This is primarily used by a client to prove it's identity to a server over an insecure network connection using symmetric (or secret key cryptography).

The process is as follows:
1. The client/ user requests an authentication ticket called TGT (ticket granting ticket).
2. The Windows Server/ Domain Controller/ Ticket Granting Server (TGS) has a KDC (key Distribution Center) which verifies the credentials and sends back an encrypted TGT.
3. The client sends the current TGT to the TGS with the name of the resource the client wants to access (Request Ticket).
4. The TGS sends a valid session key for the service to the client.
5. The client stores the TGT and when it expires, the local session manager will request another TGT (from the Windows Server).
6. The client then requests the service using the valid session key
7. Server authentication occurs.
