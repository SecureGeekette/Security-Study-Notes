GDPR is basically a set of rules that places limits on what organizations can do with personal data and enhance how people can access information about them. Personal data should include name, location data, a clear username, IP address or cookie identifiers. Sensitive personal data also includes genetic or biometric data, health information, religious beliefs etc.

Individuals or organizations are either 'controllers' or 'processors' of data. 'Controllers' are the decision makers - they exercise control over the purposes and means of processing personal data.
