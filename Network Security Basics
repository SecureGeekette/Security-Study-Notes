Common ports involving security, what are the risks and mitigations?

1. Port 22 (SSH): Secure Shell protocol is used for remote access to servers.

Risk: Unauthorized access to the system via brute-force attacks, password guessing or sniffing.
Mitigations: 
- If possible, disable password based authentication and use key based auth. If not possible, enforce strong and unique passwords.
- Implement Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies (to prevent against brute force attacks)
- Limit SSH access to specific IP addresses or networks.
- Log and monitor SSH login attempts for suspicious activities - block IP addresses after multiple failed logon attempts.
- Change the default SSH port to reduce exposure to automated attacks.
- Disable root login via SSH to reduce attack surface.

2. Port 23 (Telnet): Unencrypted Text based protocol that allows users to remotely access systems.

Risk: Does not require authentication, anyone who can connect to port 23 can gain access - elevates risk of anauthorized access.
Mitigations:
- If possible, disable telnet and utilize SSH instead.
- Restrict Telnet traffic to trusted internal networks, preventing external access to port 23 (using firewalls, security groups, network access control lists).
- Log and monitor Telnet usage to detect and prevent unauthorized usage

3. Port 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): protocol used to send email

Risk: Email spoofing, phishing, spam and malware distribution
Mitigations:
- Use email filtering services and antivirus software to detect and block malicious emails.
- Implement SPF (sender policy framework)
- Implment DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
- Implement DMARC (Domain based message authentication, reporting and conformance)

4. Port 53 (Domain Name System)

Risk: DNS Spoofing, DDoS attacks
Mitigations:
- Implement DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) for your domain to ensure data integrity and authenticity in DNS responses - basically sign DNS data with cryptographic signatures
- Use rate limiting and employ DNS filtering (block access to malicious or phishing websites) to prevent against DDoS
- Chose a reputable DNS Hosting provider
- Configure firewalls to allow DNS traffic only trusted sources

5. Port 80 (HTTP) or Port 443 (HTTPS)

Risk: Web vulnerabilities, Data interception
Mitigations:
- Implement web application firewalls (WAFs) to filter malicious traffic and protect against attacks like SQL injection and XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
- Regularly update and patch web applications and web servers.
- Use HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping/ man-in-the-middle attacks.

6. Port 139, 445 (SMB - Server Message Block)
