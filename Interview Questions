If you were to start your job as a security engineer in a well established org, what would your priorities be?

Basics: What is the important data? (Healthcare/ financial etc.) Who/ which processes interacts with it?
Network diagrams (cloud/ onprem, mixed), visibility touch points (what is visible/ accessible to the external world), ingress & egress filtering
Previous penetration tests, vulnerability assessments
What's being logged/ audited? Any alerts configured on top of the collected logs? 
Project prioritization, normal communication styles (how to interact with the devops engineers, product engineers etc.), culture for the team and company
Where's the repository of information - Confluence or Github etc.?
How can we access/ contribute to it?


Can you give some examples of processes that can be employed to find vulnerabilities/ security issues in the modern day tech stack?
Penetration tests, Vulnerability assessments (Nexpose/Nessus/Qualys), SAST, DAST, SCA scanning (Microfocus, Synopsys, Snyk), Secret Scanning (Trufflehog, Reposcanner), Container Scanning (Aqua), CSPM (Sonrai), internal audit, risk & compliance assessments


How would you rate/ score a vulnerability?
Attack vector (remote, local, physical), attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, CIA impact, exploit code maturity, remediation level, report confidence, other threat intelligence feeds

How would you go about addressing these vulnerabilities?
Prioritization (based on product specifics), integrate processes with prodsec/devops lifecyle, JIRA tickets, SLA's etc.

Have you worked with any IaC tools like Terraform, CloudFormation etc.? What are some of the security implications with infrastructure/ network as code?
Insecure IaC configurations such as configuring open security groups, public ssh/ database access etc. increases the attack surface.
IaC templates generally use base images stored in registries, there could be vulnerabilities in these AMI/ Docker images
Ghost resources - untagged resources built using IaC give us incomplete observability in the cloud environment. This also causes cloud posture drifts that are undetected for long periods
Maintain immutability of infrastructure by monitoring for posture drifts
Any update, fix or modification must be implemented only via IaC, build and break earlier versions
Unauthorized privilege escalations since IaC's are used to provision full stack cloud environments that include Kubernetes, containers and other microservices, many developers use privileges accounts to provision the same (for eg. the container process runs as root unless we explicitly specify a user). When combined with hard coded secrets and network exposures it's a serious breach path.


What is a CI/CD pipeline? Describe the elements of a CI/ CD pipeline.
Continuous integration/ Continuous Deployment pipeline
Series of steps to be performed in order to deliver new version of the software.

How do you attack VPN?



What happens when you visit google.com in browser?

When you type "google.com" into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, several processes occur behind the scenes to load the Google homepage. Here is a simplified overview of the steps involved:

Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution:

The browser initiates a DNS lookup to translate the human-readable domain "google.com" into an IP address. This process involves querying DNS servers to obtain the IP address associated with the domain.

Establishing a TCP Connection:
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the web server at that IP address. For secure connections (HTTPS), a secure handshake using TLS (Transport Layer Security) occurs to establish an encrypted connection.

HTTP Request:
The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the Google web server. The request includes information such as the type of request (GET in this case) and additional headers.

Server Processing:
The Google web server processes the request and generates a response. In the case of the Google homepage, the server may dynamically generate the HTML content to be sent back to the browser.

HTML Response:
The server sends back an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) response to the browser. The HTML contains the structure of the webpage, including links to external resources such as stylesheets, scripts, and images.

Fetching External Resources:
The browser parses the HTML response and identifies external resources that need to be fetched, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. The browser sends additional requests to fetch these resources.

Rendering the Webpage:
The browser renders the webpage by combining the HTML content with stylesheets and executing JavaScript code. The rendered webpage is then displayed on the user's screen.

DNS Caching and Browser Cache:
To improve performance, the browser caches DNS information and stores copies of resources locally (in the browser cache). Subsequent visits to the same website may use these cached resources to reduce load times.

Ongoing Communication:
The browser may continue to communicate with the server to fetch additional resources or updates dynamically without requiring a full page reload. This interaction enhances the user experience by providing dynamic content.

User Interaction:
The user can interact with the webpage, perform searches, click on links, and engage with various features provided by the Google homepage.
It's important to note that the actual process involves more complexity, especially when considering optimizations, security measures, and the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to deliver content efficiently. The steps outlined here provide a high-level overview of the fundamental processes involved in loading a webpage like Google's homepage.

What is ARP poisoning and how do you mitigate it?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a network attack where an attacker sends fake or malicious Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages to associate their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This can lead to traffic redirection, interception, or even a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

Here's a brief overview of ARP poisoning and some mitigation strategies:

How ARP Poisoning Works:
ARP Protocol: ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in local networks. Each device maintains an ARP table to store these mappings.
Normal ARP Resolution: When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it sends an ARP request asking, "Who has this IP address?" The device with that IP address responds with its MAC address.
ARP Poisoning Attack: In ARP poisoning, an attacker sends fake ARP responses, claiming to be the legitimate owner of an IP address. Other devices on the network then update their ARP tables with the attacker's MAC address.

Consequences:
With successful ARP poisoning, the attacker can intercept, modify, or redirect the traffic between the affected devices, leading to potential security breaches.

Mitigation Strategies for ARP Poisoning:
Use ARP Spoofing Detection Tools: Deploy ARP spoofing detection tools or intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can identify unusual ARP behavior on the network.

Static ARP Entries: Manually configure static ARP entries on critical devices, which can help prevent the automatic updating of ARP tables based on malicious ARP responses.
Enable Port Security: Port security features on network switches can limit the number of MAC addresses allowed on a port, making it more difficult for an attacker to insert their own MAC address.
Network Segmentation: Implement network segmentation to isolate critical segments of the network. This limits the scope of ARP poisoning attacks.
Use ARP Spoofing Prevention Software: Deploy specialized ARP spoofing prevention software or tools that actively monitor and block ARP spoofing attempts.
Static ARP Cache Configuration: Manually configure static ARP caches on critical devices, specifying the correct IP-to-MAC address mappings.
Encryption and Authentication: Use encryption (e.g., WPA3 for Wi-Fi) to protect wireless communication, and implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
Network Monitoring: Regularly monitor network traffic and logs for signs of ARP poisoning. Unusual ARP activity can be an indicator of a potential attack.
Educate Users:Educate network users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks and the importance of being cautious when prompted to accept unknown ARP responses.
Implement Network Access Controls: Use network access controls, such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), to restrict communication between different parts of the network.

If you were an attacker who compromised a CA and stole the private key, how would you use it?

Explain SSL handshake. How do certificates get provisioned?

The SSL handshake is a crucial process that occurs at the beginning of a secure communication session over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) or other SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. The handshake is responsible for establishing a secure connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server. During the SSL handshake, several steps are taken to authenticate both parties, negotiate encryption parameters, and exchange cryptographic keys.

Here is an overview of the SSL handshake process:

Client Hello:

The client initiates the handshake by sending a "ClientHello" message to the server. This message includes information about the client's supported SSL/TLS versions, encryption algorithms, and other capabilities.
Server Hello:

Upon receiving the "ClientHello," the server responds with a "ServerHello" message. This message includes information about the selected SSL/TLS version, encryption algorithm, and other parameters. The server may also include its digital certificate.
Server Certificate:

The server sends its digital certificate to the client. This certificate contains the server's public key, information about the server, and the digital signature of a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the authenticity of the certificate.
Key Exchange:

The key exchange phase allows the client and server to agree on a set of symmetric encryption keys to be used for securing the actual data transmission. Various methods, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, can be used for key exchange.
Authentication and Verification:

The client verifies the server's digital certificate to ensure the server's identity and authenticity. This involves checking the certificate's validity, verifying the CA's digital signature, and confirming that the certificate matches the server's identity.
Pre-master Secret:

The client generates a random "pre-master secret" and encrypts it using the server's public key from the received certificate. The server decrypts this message using its private key to obtain the shared secret.
Session Key Derivation:

Both the client and server independently derive the session keys from the exchanged pre-master secret and other parameters negotiated during the handshake. These session keys are used for symmetric encryption and message integrity.
Finished Messages:

Both the client and server send "Finished" messages to indicate that the handshake is complete. The encryption parameters and session keys are now established, and subsequent communication is secured.
Secure Data Transmission:

With the session keys in place, the client and server can now securely exchange data using symmetric encryption. The SSL/TLS protocol ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted information.

The provisioning of certificates involves obtaining a digital certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The process generally includes:

Certificate Request:
The entity (e.g., a web server) generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which contains information about the entity and its public key.

Submission to CA:
The CSR is submitted to a trusted CA, along with the necessary information for identity verification.

Identity Verification:
The CA verifies the identity of the entity requesting the certificate. This process may involve domain ownership validation, organization verification, or extended validation procedures.

Certificate Issuance:
Upon successful verification, the CA issues a digital certificate. The certificate includes the entity's public key, information about the entity, the CA's digital signature, and other relevant details.

Certificate Installation:
The entity installs the issued certificate on its server or device, making the public key and other certificate details accessible during the SSL handshake.
The SSL handshake, along with the provisioning of certificates, plays a crucial role in ensuring secure and authenticated communication over the internet. It establishes the foundation for encrypted and trusted interactions between clients and servers.



You see high volume of traffic to 169.254.169.254, what do you suspect?

A high volume of traffic to the IP address 169.254.169.254 is indicative of potential probing or malicious activity, especially in the context of cloud computing environments. In cloud environments, this IP address is often associated with the metadata service provided by cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The metadata service allows virtual machines or instances within the cloud to retrieve information about themselves and the environment they are running in.

Here are some considerations when observing high traffic to 169.254.169.254:

Metadata Service Abuse:
The metadata service is intended for legitimate communication between instances and the cloud provider's infrastructure. Unusual or high volumes of traffic may indicate attempts to abuse the service for unauthorized access, reconnaissance, or exploitation.

Security Vulnerabilities:
High traffic to this IP address might be associated with attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities in the cloud platform. Malicious actors may try to gather sensitive information or gain unauthorized access by exploiting misconfigurations or weaknesses in the metadata service.

Instance Compromise:
A sudden increase in traffic to 169.254.169.254 could be a sign of a compromised instance that is actively communicating with the metadata service to extract information or execute commands.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attempt:
Malicious actors may attempt to overload the metadata service with a high volume of requests, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This could impact the normal functioning of the affected instances.
